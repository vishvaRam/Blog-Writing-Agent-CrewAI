### 5. Dev.to-Specific Formatting Verification:

- **Markdown Formatting:** The content was provided in standard Markdown and published as such. Headings, lists, bold text, code blocks (if any), and image embeddings are consistent with Dev.to's Markdown interpretation.
- **Tags:** The following relevant tags were applied, optimizing for discoverability within the developer community: `#AI`, `#MachineLearning`, `#LLM`, `#MixtureOfExperts`, `#MoE`, `#DeepLearning`, `#DeepSeek`, `#GPT4`, `#ModelMerging`, `#TechExplained`, `#ScalableAI`, `#DeveloperTools`, `#ArtificialIntelligence`. Dev.to will automatically normalize these to lowercase and limit the number of displayed tags to 4 on the article card, but all provided tags contribute to searchability.

---

### 6. Publication Success Status and Analytics Setup:

- **Publication Status:** Successful. The article is live on Dev.to.
- **Analytics:** Dev.to automatically tracks basic metrics like `public_reactions_count` and `page_views_count`. These metrics can be monitored directly on the Dev.to platform under the user's dashboard for the published article. No additional setup is required for basic analytics.
