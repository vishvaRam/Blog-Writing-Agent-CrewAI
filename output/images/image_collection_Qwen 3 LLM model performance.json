The provided image for "open source AI" featuring ChatGPT is not suitable. The blog post is about Qwen 3, an open-source alternative, and using a proprietary model's image would be counterproductive. The image for "AI coding" with code projections on a woman's face is abstract and professional, but perhaps not directly illustrative of 'coding'. I will search for better general technology/AI images for the featured image and more direct coding/development images for supporting content, then an image for local AI. I will try "developer AI" for the featured image, "programming AI" for the coding section, and "local server computer" for the Ollama section.
