I have identified three images that are highly relevant to the topic of AI, neural networks, and the concept of a "brain" or "network" which aligns well with Mixture of Experts.

Image 1 (ID: 17483868) is a good candidate for the featured image due to its abstract nature and strong visual representation of AI/brain.
Image 2 (ID: 17484975) and Image 3 (ID: 17483869) are good candidates for supporting images, as they also depict neural networks and AI concepts. I will choose one of them for the supporting image. I will choose image 17483869 as it looks slightly more dynamic.

I will now optimize and curate these images with the Stock Image Optimizer and Curator tool.
