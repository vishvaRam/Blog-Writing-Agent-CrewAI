Hello everyone. I welcome you all to Geekyscript. Today I'm going to show you how to install Quain 3 on Windows operating system and after that I'm also going to show you how to use this latest Quen 3 model. So first we need to install Olama and then on top of that we need to install Quen 3. So for that first we need to go to favorite browser. I to type over here Olama download hit enter. So that will show you this ulama.com. So simply go to their official site of Olama. So this link I'm going to provide right in your channel description. So depending upon what operating system you're using Mac OS, Linux or Windows to proceed with that. For Windows, I'm going to just simp click on download for Windows and immediately our setup going to be rightly started downloading. I have already downloaded it. So that's why I'm going to cancel it. I'm going to minimize my browser and I'll go to my download directory. And here is our Olama setup. Just double click on that setup. You can see the file size as well. It is 701 MB. So you can minimize your download directory. And here just simp click on install. So that going to immediately start installing our Olama. So it's going to take couple of minutes. So let's come back once Olama gets installed. So we'll come back. So now you can clearly see that our Olama is rightly installed and our Ola is also rightly opened. Once you have Ola you can verify it. Just go to search and type cmd to open your command prompt. And within command prompt if you just simply type and just simply hit enter you're going to get this type of prompt. So if you're getting this type of prompt then all that basically means you have installed. Next is we need to install Quinn. So for that go to your browser again and go to models. Here you will see all these different models. So I'm going to show you how to use all these different models locally on your system. So first I'll start with Quinn. Then on my next video I'm going to show you how to use it for Gamerma 3, Deep Seek, Llama everything. So you know do subscribe and keep watching all these different videos. I'm going to also show you how to use them. So we'll start with Queen 3. So you need to select quen 3 and once when you are here you will see all these different versions are available for quen 3 right. So we are going to download the latest one. So we have this command for that. So just copy this command click on this icon copy it minimize it and just right click and paste it over here. Hit enter after that. So that going to immediately start downloading our locally on your system. You can see it is really a big model like 5.2 GB. So it's going to take about 7 minutes or nearly 8 minute you can say. So it's going to take significant amount of time and significant amount of bandwidth as well. So by the time it get done I'll show you this interface of Olama. Let's maximize it. So here you can see we have if you click on this drop-down you can see all these different models it is showing right. So GPTO oss then deepseeek gamma 3 coin and all that right. So you might be thinking that these models are already available so you can switch it from here and you can you know use all these models but no you know when you type something here like let's say you are asking this model so something like what is python let's say you want to ask this so when you hit enter you're going to only see that it going to download this model because that is not there so that is what I'm doing right now all right so you need to download this different model like Quinn 3, GMA or dips. So you need to download it first then only you can use these models. So you can download it from your command prompt using those command. So like if you go to your browser you can use it by just simply using this command from your command prompt or else that same thing going to run behind the scene as well when you you know switch to all these different models. So let's wait for some time. Let's wait for our Quen 3 to get installed. So let's come back after 6 and 1/2 minutes. So we'll come back. So now you can clearly see that our Quen 3 is rightly downloaded and it is pulling and it is verifying it. So soon it will be done. And there you go. So you can see it is done now. She can start chatting with queen 3 right over here. She can ask something like what is Java programming in short. So you can ask anything literally to quen 3 model. So you can see it is typing you back and best part is it is running locally on your system. So whatever thing that you are asking so that data will be located to your system already. So unlike like you are asking some question to chat GPT or Gemini. So whatever you are asking is directly going to them right. But all these things that you are doing now will stay to your local system only. So it going to be completely private to you. So you can see it is answering that Java is a programming languages developed by Sun Microsystem. Now it's owned by Oracle. So it is known for being a platform independent. So there's the response uh you can get on your command prompt itself. Since it is running locally and my system is a bit older configurations. So I am just using only 8 gigs of RAM and i3 processor. So that's why it's it's a bit slow. But if you are using some higher end of system then it going to be really quick and smooth. All right. So that's why it's a bit slow over here but you get the point right how to download and set it up Olama for quen 3 so that you have understood. So I'm going to terminate this by pressing Ctrl Z on my keyboard. So now we are we are out of it and I'm going to show you how you can use this queen 3. So you need to select this model. So Quin 38B is the latest one. So if you go to your browser you can see coin 38B is the latest one. So that is what we have downloaded and we have selected that same model. And here also you can ask that same questions. It's going to ask something like give me hello world snippet of Python. Hit enter. So we can see that 3 is rightly started answering again. It's it's a bit slow on my system because I'm just using i3 processor but I have checked it on on my higherend CPU. So there I I have clearly seen that this is performing way better than this. All right. So you don't need to worry. So you can see it is clearly answering me right. So print hello world hello world snippet in Python. And there you go. So it is finally answered. It also shows the output, right? Just like it shows in chat GPT and other models, right? So that's how you install Quinn and use it locally on your system on Olama. So in my next video, I'm going to show you how to use Gamerma 3, then Llama, Deepseek and all that. So keep watching this video series and also if you're interested on Python, I highly recommend you to follow this cool Python project playlist. So all these videos are completely free. If you are watching these videos then I am sure you're going to love them. So the best part is detailed source code of whatever things that I have taught you on all these videos are also available on our official geekyskid.com website. So for example the one of the video is this rock paper scissor game. So here is the video and the details source code also you're going to get. So full GUI code you can directly copy it. You can create your very own rock paper scissor game and can you know showcase this as a project to your resume which ultimately going to help you to land to your dream job. All right. So yeah, so that's pretty much all about this video. Please do like, share and subscribe that going to really motivate me to make more the similar kind of videos. So that's basically all about this video friends. Thank you very much for watching this video and God bless you

Remember Open Code, the fastest AI CLI coding agent? Well, it has now been revamped to Crush CLI, a new coding agent that's even better for your terminal. Crush is a high performance agentic coding tool built with the Charm libraries, and it's something that has a playful aesthetic that makes you really want to use this over other CLI tools. Crush CLI is by the original developer of Open Code, who recently joined the charm team, and it's fully based on Go, making it incredibly fast and responsive. This makes it currently the fastest, reliable AI CLI coding agent. With Crush, it has an extensive set of tools, plugins, and adaptable workflows while having the flexibility to wire any large language model of your choice. It's built for speed and performance and you can see the tui looks absolutely amazing in comparison to cloud code or many of the other CLI tools that we have showcased. You have the ability to select multi models where you can choose a wide range of different large singish models or bring your own via open AI or enthropics compatible APIs. It's flexible where you can switch between different models midsession. So if there's a particular model you would use for a certain generation, you can switch between that model with the base model that you have already running. It's session based where you can maintain multiple work sessions and context per project. There's the ability to have it running simultaneously which is awesome. It's LSP enhanced which is where it gives Crush deep realtime code intelligence from your actual project files. Whereas something with like cloud code, it relies solely on just AI reasoning without direct LSP powered uh context. But that's why this is something that was hyped with the open code project over the cloud code project cuz there was this LSP enhanced functionality which brings in additional context for your actual session. It's extensible with capabilities via MCPs as well as different tool sets and plugins and works anywhere with different operating systems. Before we get started, I just want to mention that you should definitely go ahead and subscribe to the world of AI newsletter. I'm constantly posting different newsletters on a weekly basis. So, this is where you can easily get up-to-date knowledge about what is happening in the AI space. So, definitely go ahead and subscribe as this is completely for free. Now to install this, you can use different package managers and it works with mpm homebrew or you have the ability to use go. But since I'm on Windows, we're going to be using scoop to install this. It's super simple. Go ahead and copy this command. Open up your command prompt. Paste this in. This will start checking the repo and have charm installed. And then now we just need to install the CLI by copying the scoop install crush command which will go ahead and install it. And now to start it up, it's super simple. we'll just use the crush command. But if you do not know how to install it, just simply go ahead and make sure you install it based off the operating system you have. But now that we have it installed, let's go ahead and select our model. You have so many different providers that you can use. You have the new open AI GBT 5 model, which is pretty good for coding. But say if you want a free model, you can actually use Open Routers free model list. This is where they offer a lot of different coding models even the new uh coin 3 coder which is exceptional. So if you want I highly recommend that you use that model particularly for generation you can select it by simply clicking enter and then you can use it with crush cli. Next after you have selected the model you have the ability to initialize crush cli within a project so that it gets familiarized with the codebase. This is where it can examine the project and then put the results into the crush MD file which serves as general context. But since we don't actually have any sort of project that we want crushed CLI to be deployed in, we're going to click on nope. And now we have the ability to essentially get started with crush CLI. If you click Ctrl P, you're going to be able to get a comprehensive list of different commands that you can use from switching sessions, switching models, toggling YOLO mode, as well as a couple of other things, even like initializing a project. Now, let me just showcase the ability to toggle and switch between sessions. This is where you can switch between another subtask, right, directly within the original task that we have. So in this case, if you're building something, you can have one session focused on building a component like a front end and then the other working on the back end simultaneously. So I can say something like create me a note-taking app with a lot of features. And you can see how intuitive this actually looks. This is a lot better looking than many of the different CLI tools that I have showcased on this channel. Right away, you have the ability to approve commands that are being sent to you from the actual CLI. And you can allow this or allow it only for the session. We're going to go ahead and click on allow. And you can see that it's going to then work on building the new application and work on generating all the files live in action. And on the right hand side, you're going to be able to see the amount of tokens used as well as in this case, I'm actually not using the free open router API due to the rate limit. I'm using my own API key. But you can see right now that it is working on the index.html file, and you're going to be able to view the diff eddits directly within the terminal, which is pretty impressive. This is where I can allow it, and I can have it work on coding out the rest of the files. And after it has finished generating the code for your app, in this case, it is wanting to run the command to start it up. So, we can click on allow. And we're going to be able to now visualize what it has now generated. And there we go. This is our advanced note-taking app where you have the ability to write in any sort of note. Make a YouTube video on Crush CLI. And then I can click on save. And there we go. We have our note now as a personal note tagged on the lefth hand panel. Now this is a super simple app that was created but you have a lot of different functionalities like adding in a picture. So in this case I can go ahead and add in this picture and this is a simple note-taking app that was fully coded out with the coin 3 model with the agents deployed from crush cli. Now if you actually press ctrlg you have the ability to focus on a particular chat. You have the ability to even go into commands sessions with the control S feature. You can manage through different sessions live in action. So in this case, this is one of the note-taking apps that we can access directly or we can switch into another chat. But you also have the ability to go back and add images. So if I press on Ctrl+F, I can go ahead and attach an image so that the model can then use that as a design or use that as a wireframe to work on coding out next component or simply just adding it as reference. In the same way, you can add files as well. And then you can even open up the editor. If you press control0, you can open up your code editor. I have it as a notepad right now, but in this case, you can open up VS Code to edit any of the files that it has generated directly from the terminal to the IDE. Next up, I want to try something else. This is where I wanted to create a modern image editor app with the YOLO mode enabled where it's going to be able to autonomously build out all the components of this application for me. So, let's see what it actually ends up generating. And there we go. Just like that, we have our advanced image editor. You have the ability to upload various sorts of pictures. Let's say I want to upload this thumbnail for today's upload. Crush CLI. You have the ability to change the canvas size live in action. You also have it so that you can brush or erase certain sections. You can even draw certain components, change the color. And all of this was fully generated with the help of Quen Coder, which was really insane. And thanks to the different agents deployed by CR CLI, it did a great job in generating this overall platform. If you like this video and would love to support the channel, you can consider donating to my channel through the super thanks option below. Or you can consider joining our private Discord where you can access multiple subscriptions to different AI tools for free on a monthly basis, plus daily AI news and exclusive content, plus a lot more. Overall, I personally find Crush to be super fast because it's written in Go, and it gives exceptional speed and responsiveness, outpacing many of the other agents. Its session based context management is definitely nice where it rivals up against the Claude sub agent that they've just introduced. It's also something that has deep real-time intelligence with the LSP, which makes it appealing. And overall, if they are to keep continuously working on this and make it better, it's going to be a great option to use, maybe even your primary CLI agent that you would go to. But that's basically it, guys, for today's video on Crush CLI. This is something that I highly recommend that you take a look at with the links in the description below. Make sure you subscribe to the second channel, join the newsletter, join our Discord, follow me on Twitter, and lastly, make sure you guys subscribe, turn on notification bell, like this video, and please take a look at our previous videos because there's a lot of content that you will truly benefit from. But with that thought, guys, have an amazing day, spread positivity, and I'll see you guys really shortly. He suffers.

That was just truly unexpected. Today, the Alibaba team dropped a groundbreaking new open-source language model with quite the name Coin 3 235B A22B 257. But aside from the name, what's wild is that this release is a serious gamecher in the open- source field. Just last week, we were talking about Kimmy K2, which performed exceptionally well across the board while being fully open source. And now we have Coin Theory's latest upgrade that is already outperforming it in nearly every way possible, setting new state-of-the-art benchmarks. So what exactly is this model? Well, this new Coin 3 upgraded model is a new open-source giant with 235 billion total parameters and 22 billion active parameters. Interestingly, unlike their hybrid reasoning models, this release isn't just using a hybrid thinking mode. Instead, Alibaba trained two separate models with distinct purposes to maximize quality. An instruct model which is focused on following instructions and dialogue. Then you have a thinking model which is designed for deeper logical reasoning and planning. This dual approach is what enables massive improvements in general capabilities. We're talking about instruction following, logic, text comprehension, science, coding, and tool usage. It's also bringing substantial gains in longtail knowledge across many languages and it has an enhanced 256k context understanding. Now even more impressive is that it is better in line with human preference which is especially for subjective or open-ended tasks making it more helpful in conversation and creative writing. But in terms of benchmarks this is where I was interested the most cuz this is a model that really shines in this case. It is a model that is reporting exceptional benchmarks in coding, math, agentic testing, and tool use. It goes head-to-head and performs exceptionally well with heavyweights like Kimmy K2. In this case, it's outperforming it for Opus, the non-thinking version, and the DeepSeek V3. Now, to access this model, you can actually do so through Quen's chatbot. And this is where you can access this new model which is available under the Quen 3 235B A22B model card. Now you also have the ability to access the model cards the instruct version as well as the thinking mode off of hogging phase meaning that you have the ability to install this locally. To do so you can use Olama or LM Studio to install different quantiz versions of this model series. You can also use this model completely for free through open router. They provide a free API which lets you access it through client kilo code or even something like root code. Before we get started, I just want to mention that you should definitely go ahead and subscribe to the world of AI newsletter. I'm constantly posting different newsletters on a weekly basis. So this is where you can easily get up-to-date knowledge about what is happening in the AI space. So definitely go ahead and subscribe as this is completely for free. And just want to make it clear that this is the non-thinking model. The thinking model is still on its way, but the non-thinking model also has ability to enable thinking so that it adds more reasoning to its answer output. Let's first start off with this prompt to create a butterfly in SVG code. We're trying to see how well it is in terms of outputting SVG code and how well it is in terms of representing a butterfly with it. So, let's see what it's able to output. So, I've gotten the code and now I'm on this online SVG viewer and I'm going to paste it in. And there we go. This actually looks remarkable. You can see that it has done a great job in creating the front and back wings while making it symmetrical. The design looks pretty awesome. And in my opinion, it did a really great job in this test of generating SVG code. Next up, I want to see how well this model is in terms of its front-end capabilities. I wanted to create a responsive task management web app with the following features with a calendar view, a task list UI, option to mark task as complete, and bringing in creativity to make this app better. Now, I'm going to be not enabling the thinking mode now, and I want to see what it's capable of outputting. Let's see what it generates. So, there we go. We have our task flow, a responsive task magic app that was fully generated. Now, I should have just simply used their artifacts to just visualize it within their chatbot, but I forgot to click it and it generated over a thousand lines of code. In this case, it generated approximately 1300. But I've now copied it and pasted into this online HTML viewer. And this is our Task Flow app. Now, if I was to open it up within a full page, it would look a lot better. So, let's just preview that. And there we go. It has integrated the calendar we had requested and it has done a really good job in creating the base structure for this task manager app. It has animations. It has integrated my task important task completed in a settings tab. And I can simply go ahead and add a task and it'll be displayed within the calendar based off the date I provide. Now, next up, what we're going to be doing is testing out this model within client. This is where I'm going to have it write Python code to scrape YouTube videos, then visualize the data in a bar chart using Mattplot Lib. So, let's see how well it is in terms of its agentic capabilities in planning where it's able to focus on different sequences as well as reasoning and tool usage if necessary with this prompt. So, looks like this model is doing a pretty decent job so far in creating the API awareness where it's able to uh focus on the right libraries and it is going to be able to use these different tools to help me scrape YouTube data. So, it looks like I ran the script and it looks like it's working. It was able to successfully scrape the data from the YouTube trending page where it was able to scrape all these different videos as well as the amount of views as and you can see that within this par uh data.json file it has all the different uh metrics like the title the channel the views and you can see the first trending video is Predator from Badlands and you can see that it was able to scrape that data and then paste it in. That's how it was able to do it. And overall, it did a great job in accomplishing this task pretty quickly. Next up, I'm going to be asking it a reasoning prompt. This is a pretty hard prompt where I'm asking it, "A farmer has a fox, a chicken, a bag of grain. He needs to cross a river, but can only take one item at a time to his boat. If left alone, the fox will eat the chicken, and the chicken will eat the grains. How can the farmer get all three across the river safely?" Now, this is essentially where we're trying to see how well it is in terms of answering a classic constraintbased logic puzzle. Essentially, we're just trying to see how well the model is in terms of tracking the state of multiple entities, the location, how well it is in outputting all these different outcomes. And correctly, it's able to output all the different steps as I read through it. And it did provide me a correct summary of all the steps where it first takes the chicken across and then returns alone. Takes the fox across but brings the chicken back and then takes the grain across and returns uh back and then takes the chicken across and all of them cross safely. And this is where it was able to get this answer pretty quickly and reason through this hard difficult prompt. If you like this video and would love to support the channel, you can consider donating to my channel through the super thanks option below. Or you can consider joining our private Discord where you can access multiple subscriptions to different AI tools for free on a monthly basis, plus daily AI news and exclusive content, plus a lot more. But that's basically it guys for today's video on this new impressive new model. I really love what they have done. This is a minor update which has resulted in an impressive outcome in terms of its performance. It is really impressive in coding as well as in reasoning and we still have a lot of new upgrades coming to this model series. I really like how they took out the hybrid thinking mode as I believe that was restricting it from being a bit better in terms of its performance. Now that there is two separate models, the reasoning as well as the instruct model, I think this is a great move that they took it out cuz it is going to be cleaner with its purpose-built models. So if you want to use a reasoning model, you can just simply stick to this reasoning model. And then if you want to use instruct base model, you can just use it this way. It's going to be better instead of relying on to guess the best mode for midcast. And in this case, you can just simply go to the model of your choice based off of the prompt that you want outputed. But that's basically it, guys. I hope you enjoyed today's video. Let me know what you guys think. This is something that you can access completely for free with the.3 Open router.
