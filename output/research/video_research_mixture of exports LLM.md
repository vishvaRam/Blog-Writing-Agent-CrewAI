### Transcript 1: A Visual Guide to Mixture of Experts (MoE) in LLMs (`sOPDGQjFcuM`)

```
welcome to a visual guide to mixure of experts my name is Mara and today we are going through an amazing technique used in the realm of larger language models mixture of experts or MO is a technique that uses different submodels or experts to improve the quality of larger language models two main components Define a mo the first are experts and these experts are feed forward neural networks and at least one can be activated the router or the gate Network determines which tokens are sent to which experts in each layer of an llm with a mo we find somewhat specialized experts but know that an expert is not specialized in a specific domain like psychology or biology and at most it learns syntactic information on a token level instead the router or gate Network selects the experts that are best suited for a given input and to explore what experts represent and how they work let us first examine What mo is supposed to replace the dense layers remember that a standard decoder only Transformer architecture has the feed forward neural network applied after layer normalization the feed forward neural network uses the contextual information created by attention to capture complex relationships in the data the feed forward N Network work in a decoder only model is called a dense model since all parameters are activated looking at the dense model notice how the input activates all parameters at least to some degree we can chop up our dense model into pieces the so-called experts retrain it and only activate a subset of experts at a given time this is called a sparse model and during inference only specific experts are used us when asked a question we can select the best expert for a given task in practice experts are typically whole feed forward neural networks themselves and not just pieces of a hidden layer a given text will pass through multiple experts before the output is generated The Chosen experts likely differ between tokens which results in different parts being taken each new token may result in a different path and may activate a different set of experts this means that each time you run inference a set of experts is chosen that are best suited for the input if we update our visualization of the dense decoder with multiple feed forward neural networks it would now be called a sparse decoder thereby capturing the first part of Mo which are the experts but there's still a piece of the puzzle missing how do you choose which experts to use well that's where the router comes in and it helps us decide which expert is best suited for a given input the router together with the experts make up the mo layer in a sparse decoder and replace the single feed forward neural network we can zoom in on the mo layer and explore how this router works in detail after the feed forward neural network in the router we see a softmax function creating probabilities for each expert that are used to select and activate the best expert the final output is generated by multiplying the router probability with the expert output creating a weighted activation this entire architecture is therefore nothing more than multiple feed forward neural networks and a router selecting the best or best experts a given mode layer comes in two sizes either a dense or a sparse mixture of experts a dense mixture of experts will distribute the tokens across all experts whereas a sparse mod will only SP select a few experts when we have multiple experts selected their weighted outputs get aggregated let's explore how data flows through the mo layer in its most basic form we multiply the input X by a router weight Matrix W to create the output of the router which we call H ofx then the softmax of the output is taken to create probabilities G ofx one for each expert the router uses this probability distribution to choose the best matching expert we then take the output per selected expert and multiply that with the router probabilities we do this for every expert selected since we chose only one expert we are only doing this calculation once this create our output one vector for each expert and that is how a typical mole layer processes the data and it seems straightforward right well there's one big disadvantage during training some experts might learn faster and more than others as a result the same set of experts might be chosen too frequently regardless of the input instead we want equal importance among experts during training and inference we call this load balancing and it's to prevent overfitting on the same experts to explore advancements in load balancing let's look at how we can improve the mo layer with a method called keeptop K remember that in the first step we multiply the input with the router weights to create the output h ofx of the router with keep top K we introduce trainable Garian noise which helps us prevent the same experts from always being chosen by introducing noise some experts might accidentally get lower scores thereby giving more opportunity for other experts to train then sparity is introduced by setting the weights of all but the top two experts to minus infinity and when we process this updated output with a softmax function the output will result in a probability of zero of all the values that were set to minus infinity therefore it sets the probabilities of all but the top two experts to zero combined they allow undertrained experts to catch up to experts that were chosen more frequently and therefore had more opportunity to train routing Tok tokens to a few selected experts is also called token choice and allows for a given token to be sent to either one expert and that's called top one routing or to more than one expert we call this top K routing k for how many experts you select to further improve load balancing we can add auxiliary law loss which is also called load balancing loss to the Network's regular loss imagine that for each input token we have router probabilities that route the tokens to The Experts the first component of this auxiliary loss is to sum the router values per expert this gives us the important score per expert which represents How likely an expert will be chosen how equal the distribution of important scores is can be calculated with the coefficient variation which is simply the standard deviation divided by the mean of these important scores if there are a lot of differences in important scores the CV will be high if all experts have similar important scores the CV will be low auxiliary loss is the CV multiplied by w a constant scaling Factor the auxiliary loss is updated during training such that it aims to lower the CV as much as possible thereby creating more equal importance among the experts the auxiliary loss is added as a separate loss to optimize during training and this additional loss therefore results in a more stable training procedure where all experts are given somewhat equal chance to train imbalance however is not just found in the experts that were chosen but also in the distributions of tokens that are sent to the experts note that expert 4 has received only one token of the input whereas expert one has received all other tokens as a result compared to expert one expert 4 ends up undertrained since it receives so few tokens during training to prevent this problem we limit how many tokens they can process which we call the expert capacity by setting the expert to capacity to three this expert can only process three tokens tokens that exceed this threshold are routed to the next most likely expert in this case expert four if both experts have reached capacity any new token will not be processed by any expert but instead sent to the next layer this is referred to as token overflow and therefore it is important that we find a balance between the number of tokens an expert can process and how many will be left unprocessed a big part of what makes Mo interesting is its computational requirements since only a subset of experts are used at a given time we have access to more parameters than we're actually using although a given Mo has more parameters to load which we call the sparse parameters fewer are activated since we only use some experts during inference and we call these the active parameters in other words we still need to load the entire model onto your device these are the sparse parameters but when we run inference we only need to use a subset we call these the active parameters let's explore the number of spars versus active parameters with an example mixol 8 * 7 B and this model is an amazing large language model that uses Mo layers and its name suggests that it uses eight experts each with a size of 7 billion parameters and let's see whether that is actually true first the embeddings make up for a relatively small part of the model with 131 million parameters these are shared parameters and are used regardless of whether we load or use the model second are the parameters for the attention mechanism which is a big chunk of the entire model with more than 1 billion parameters the router has a set number of parameters per expert and it's actually quite small with only 32,000 parameters fourth are the experts although four experts are shown in this image the model actually has eight experts to choose from each expert bir actually has 5.6 billion parameters and not the suggested 7 billion most likely the reason why they mentioned 7 billion parameters is because they counted all other parameters but more on that later the total parameters of all experts is 45 billion but since the model only activates two experts at a time the active parameters are only 11 billion finally the head of the model also has a small number of parameters that are shared similar to the embeddings with 131 million parameters so the total number of parameters of the model is more than eight experts looking at all parameters we can see that the model has 47 billion parameters when loaded during inference it only needs to activate roughly 13 billion parameters making it much faster than its size would suggest and this is one of the main advantages of Mo although its size is large inference is much faster now that we have explored the basics of mixture of experts in large language models we can do the same for vision models to explore Mo in Vision models let's recap the vision Transformer first the input of a text base Transformer are sequences that are split up into tokens to perform the same tokenization process with images we instead convert them into patches and we can also call these tokens to further process these patches we flatten them into a sequence of patches this sequence is passed to a linear projection to create embeddings one for each patch the TS token or the classification token is added along with positional embeddings before being passed to the encoder the encoder in the vision Transformer is no different from an encoder that processes text to use Mo we then only need to replace the feed forward neural network with a mo layer that has the same characteristics that we've seen thus far and this is called the vision mode Mo note how we can leverage the existing architecture of Transformers to implement Mo in a vision model since images generally have many patches a low expert capacity is used for each experts to reduce Hardware constraints however a low capacity tends to lead to Patches being dropped and this is akin to token overflow to keep the capacity low a priority scorer assigns important scores to Patches so that the most important patches are processed first this results in a much more accurate representation of the original image as a result we should still see important patches routed If the percentage of tokens decreases however Vision mod still needs to drop tokens so information is lost instead let's look at an alternative namely soft mode in Vision mode the priority score helps differentiate between less important patches and more important patches however a subset of patches are assigned to each expert and information in onpress patches is lost soft Mo solves this problem and aims to go from a discrete patch assignment to a soft patch assignment by mixing patches in practice all patches are used instead of only a subset to create the soft patch we weigh each patch using the priority score and then take a linear combination of these weighted patches before we sent the soft patch to The Chosen expert to create these soft patches soft mode takes the input X patch embeddings for each patch with Dimensions D so theze of the input Factor by m the number of patches X is then multiplied by a learnable matrix f with Dimensions d by the capacity for each expert this gives us the routing Matrix R which tells us how related a certain patch is to each expert by then taking the softmax of the router Matrix and we do this on the column s we update the embeddings of each patch and as a result they are linear combinations of the input patches as we saw before and let's go through this step by step we start with the input X the embeddings for each patch and multiply that with the learnable Matrix F this gives us the routing Matrix R which tells us how related a certain token is to a given expert taking the softmax of r on the columns and multiplying that with the input gives us a linear combination of patch inputs these are routed to the best suited expert for a particular patch or soft patch input each expert processes these linear combinations of the patch embeddings to generate y the outputs the output Y is multiplied with the softmax of R but this time rowwise creating a linear combination of expert outputs instead which gives us the final output this architecture together with the router Matrix affects the input on a patch level and the output on an expert level since Transformers has found its way into the domain of vision techniques like Mo are surprisingly transferable across domains so keep in mind that whatever you learn about larger language models might also have theoretical and practical Implement Implement implications to multimodal models and that was it for this video thank you for keeping up thus far if you're interested in more content

**Analysis of Transcript 3 (based on description):** This video, from IBM Technology, appears to be a high-level explanation of MoE, similar in scope to Video 2. It promises to cover the architecture, advantages, and challenges, specifically mentioning sparse layers, routing, and load balancing. Given its source and high engagement, it would likely serve as a credible introductory resource. However, without the full transcript, a detailed content analysis is not possible.

## Key Insights and Themes Identified

Based on the analysis of the available video information and transcripts:

1.  **Core MoE Architecture:** All videos emphasize the fundamental components: multiple "experts" (feed-forward neural networks) and a "router" (or "gating network") that dynamically selects which experts process incoming tokens/data.
2.  **Sparsity for Efficiency:** A central theme is that MoE models are "sparse" because only a subset of parameters (active parameters) are utilized during inference, despite the model having a large total number of parameters (sparse parameters). This leads to significant computational efficiency and faster inference compared to dense models of similar capacity.
3.  **Load Balancing and Training Stability:** Training MoE models presents unique challenges, particularly ensuring that all experts are adequately utilized and none are "undertrained" or "over-utilized." Techniques like adding Gaussian noise, "KeepTopK" routing, and auxiliary loss (load balancing loss) are crucial for stable and effective training.
4.  **Expert Specialization:** While experts are not explicitly assigned human-defined domains, they organically specialize in different aspects of the input data distribution (e.g., syntactic information on a token level), processing different words, phrases, or sentence structures.
5.  **Practical Implementations:** Real-world examples like Mixtral 8x7B and DeepSeek-MoE are frequently cited to demonstrate the practical success and performance benefits of MoE in LLMs.
6.  **Transferability to Multimodal AI:** MoE principles are not limited to text-based LLMs but are also being successfully applied to Vision Language Models (VLMs) through architectures like Vision-MoE and Soft-MoE, indicating broader applicability across AI domains.
7.  **Overhead and Complexity:** While efficient during inference, MoE models introduce increased complexity in training, implementation, and deployment due to dynamic routing and sparse computation requirements.
